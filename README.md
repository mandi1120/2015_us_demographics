### By: Amanda Hanway, 12/25/2023  
  
## Overview  

In this project, I developed a Tableau dashboard to analyze 2015 US Census Demographic data. The data was provided in csv format and required no preprocessing steps before loading it into Tableau. This project was focused on creating visuals to convey insights from the data.  

- Data source: [acs2015_county_data.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data?resource=download&select=acs2015_county_data.csv)  
- View the Dashboard: [Tableau Public]()

-------------
The written summary should include a brief description of the visualization and state at least one finding.

A readerâ€™s summary of the graphic would closely match the written summary in the writeup, and a reader is able to identify at least one main point or relationship that the graphic attempts to convey.

To reiterate your report should include at least 3 sets of
